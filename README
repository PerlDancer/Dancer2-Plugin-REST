=head1 DESCRIPTION

This plugin helps you write a RESTful webservice with Dancer2.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

=head2 serializers

The default format serializer hash which maps a given C<:format> to 
a C<Dancer2::Serializer::*> serializer. Unless overriden in the 
configuration, it defaults to:

    serializers:
      json: JSON
      yml:  YAML
      dump: Dumper

=head1 KEYWORDS

=head2 prepare_serializer_for_format

When this pragma is used, a before filter is set by the plugin to automatically
change the serializer when a format is detected in the URI.

That means that each route you define with a B<:format> param or captures token 
will trigger a serializer definition, if the format is known.

This lets you define all the REST actions you like as regular Dancer2 route
handlers, without explicitly handling the outgoing data format.

Regexp routes will use the file-extension from captures->{'format'} to determine
the serialization format.

=head2 resource

This keyword lets you declare a resource your application will handle.

    resource user =>
        get    => sub { # return user where id = params->{id}   },
        create => sub { # create a new user with params->{user} },
        delete => sub { # delete user where id = params->{id}   },
        update => sub { # update user with params->{user}       };

    # this defines the following routes:
    # GET /user/:id
    # GET /user/:id.:format
    # POST /user
    # POST /user.:format
    # DELETE /user/:id
    # DELETE /user/:id.:format
    # PUT /user/:id
    # PUT /user/:id.:format

=head2 helpers

Some helpers are available. This helper will set an appropriate HTTP status for you.

=head3 status_ok

    status_ok({users => {...}});

Set the HTTP status to 200

=head3 status_created

    status_created({users => {...}});

Set the HTTP status to 201

=head3 status_accepted

    status_accepted({users => {...}});

Set the HTTP status to 202

=head3 status_bad_request

    status_bad_request("user foo can't be found");

Set the HTTP status to 400. This function as for argument a scalar that will be used under the key B<error>.

=head3 status_not_found
